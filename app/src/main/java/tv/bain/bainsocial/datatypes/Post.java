/*
    When a post is started it boots up a Blank Post Object
    a Screen appears to compose a post, any images selected will be fingerprinted to a MD5 hash
    Those hashes will be included in this post at the top above the text
    BAIN://ec55d3e698d289f2afd663725127bace:ec55d3e698d289f2afd663725127bace
    We will teach the code to understand anything starting with BAIN is a network Search
    in This case the first hash will be the creators uID, and the second is the ImageHash.
    for the user to have replied to your post they would of had to have connected to you
    Meaning they should be in the database. If not we can just perform a search.

    The Image Data and the Text are combined, hashed and become an ID. for the post.
    This info is then stored in the DB, recalled when your page is visited.
