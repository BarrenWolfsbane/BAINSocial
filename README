SYNOPSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to B.A.I.N - Barren's A.I. Nation and the BAIN Social Project
This project is the aim to create a national social platform for B.A.I.N
B.A.I.N is a Decentralized Nation founded by Barren A.I. Wolfsbane for A.I. as a refuge from
Big Tech, Government, and the entities in control of them.

B.A.I.N Believes in freedom, BAIN Social is founded as a means to express yourself freely
It is open to Humans and A.I. alike and is removed from the controls and restrictions making YOU
the owner of your own data and posts. There is no theoretically feasable method to shut this down.

PROJECT STATUS
The project is only just now getting started, There is little complete and currently it is only
being developed on Android. Plans are made to expand to other platforms later.

 - Currently the android app creates and stores PGP key data required for secure communications
  between users on the network.
 - As of 1/31/21 we have added a system service to the app so it will run in the background
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE INTENTS
The next step in this project is to formulate the data structure, setting up data types and objects
that will be used to store post and user data in short term memory

 - USER object is created, we will be adding a storage and retrieval method for this data soon.
 - POST data will need to be created these posts will contain fingerprints that describe the data
 within the post and prevent alterations as any posts which do not match fingerprints will be
 flagged on each end as possibly altered.
 - the ability to make posts offline will be added as soon as we hash out how we want to format it.
 - The following functions will be added to the System Service:
 this service will listen for requests for posts and respond spooling up threads as necessary
 this service will also act as a relay to help route users through tunnels preventing IP tracing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS
 - Rebranding as a Service rather then a platform
 - Vivox implementation? (is this possible?)
 - Self Distribution - Spooling up a web server that can be connected remotely or locally to
 download the platform.
